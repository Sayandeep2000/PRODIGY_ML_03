Cat vs Dog Classification Using HOG and SVM
This project implements an image classification model to distinguish between cats and dogs using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

Project Overview
The main steps of this project are:

Data Preparation: Load images and preprocess them.
Feature Extraction: Extract HOG features from the images.
Model Training: Train an SVM classifier with the extracted features.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the classifier on test data and calculate accuracy.
Dataset
The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs. It is organized into two directories, Cat and Dog, each containing the respective images.
